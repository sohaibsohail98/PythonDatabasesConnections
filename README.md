#Welcome to the README of Database Connection presentations:

## This is a repository to represent the connection and its integration between database and python. 

##Three main files are shown in this repository: main_queries.py, OOP_connection.py and outputmain.py.

## Using inheritance, importing the connection file to the queries to the output, allows a smooth transition of code and allows an easier interface for the user.

## OOP_connection has the connection setup for the database to be connected to the directory. This includes the setup of the server name, password and further login details

## Using input, main queries determines the output of the user and follows a list of methods executing query results. Each of these include fetchmany, fetchall and fetchone. Each of these executions have a separate output, demonstrating the various use of SQL in python commands, including the average product price. 

## The outputmain.py file imports code from the queries and calls the function, making it into a separate file allows easier use of accessibility for the user.
